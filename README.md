# Fury-of-Dracula-2020

This is a group project I participated in to replicate computer AI players for the board game Fury of Dracula.
I was mostly in charge of the hunter AI which came 5th overall out of 70 teams. I also dabbled a bit with the Dracula AI.
We implemented many search algorithms in this project, including BFS and DFS.
This was submitted for the 2nd Assignment of COMP2521
